# Doctor Hunt Project - Java & Groovy API

This project integrates **Java** and **Groovy** to develop the **Doctor Hunt Project APIs**, a system where patients can make appointments with doctors, maintain medical records, and receive diagnosis offers. It includes features like user authentication, doctor management, and appointment scheduling.

The application is built using **Spring Boot** for the backend, with **PostgreSQL** as the database. The project uses **DTO (Data Transfer Objects)** for managing data flow between layers, ensuring smooth communication between components.

## Project Overview

This project includes:

- **Patient Appointment Management**: Patients can book appointments with doctors.
- **Medical Records Management**: Store and manage patient medical records for ongoing and historical reference.
- **Doctor Diagnosis Offers**: Doctors can create and manage diagnostic tests offered to patients.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for both patients and doctors.
- **Spring Boot Backend**: RESTful APIs using Spring Boot framework to handle business logic and database interaction.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Reliable relational database to store patient, doctor, appointment, and medical record data.
- **Groovy Scripting**: Groovy is used to dynamically script and enhance functionality, allowing quick changes or new features to be implemented easily.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Patients and doctors can register, log in, and authenticate via JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Appointment Booking**: Patients can view available doctors and book appointments based on time slots.
- **Medical Records**: Patients' medical records are stored securely, allowing doctors to add or view historical information.
- **Diagnosis Test Offers**: Doctors can add available diagnostic tests to their profiles for patients to select.
- **Spring Boot & PostgreSQL**: The project uses Spring Boot to create robust backend APIs and PostgreSQL for data persistence.
- **DTO (Data Transfer Objects)**: DTOs are used to transfer data between layers efficiently, ensuring proper structuring of API responses.

## Guidelines
Run the example of connecting to OpenFin and creating applications

1. Clone this repository

2. Go to release directory and start run.bat

3. Once the java app starts, click on Start button, which should start OpenFin Runtime.  The java app will wait and try to connect to OpenFin Runtime.

4. Once OpenFin Runtime is started and Java app connects successfully,  "Create Application" button is enabled.  You can click on the button to bring up a dialog for entering configuration of any HTML5 app.  By default, the dialog is pre-populated with configuration for Hello OpenFin demo app.

5. You can use buttons in Window Control section to move and re-size HTML5 window of Hello OpenFin app.

6. Click "Create Application" button, which should start a dialog with all the fields pre-populated for our Hello OpenFin demo HTML5 application.  Just click on "Create" button.

7. After Hello OpenFin starts, you can use the buttons under Window Control of Java app to control Hello OpenFin window.

## Source Code Review

Source code for the example is located in /src/main/java/com/openfin/desktop/demo/OpenFinDesktopDemo.java.  The followings overview of how it communicates with OpenFin Runtime with API calls supported by the Java adapter:

1. Create connection object:

```java
	this.desktopConnection = new DesktopConnection("OpenFinDesktopDemo");
```
   This code just creates an instance of DesktopConnection and it does not try to connect to runtime.

2. Launch and connect to stable version of OpenFin runtime:

```java
	// create an instance of RuntimeConfiguration and configure Runtime by setting properties in RuntimeConfiguration
	this.runtimeConfiguration = new RuntimeConfiguration();
	// launch and connect to OpenFin Runtime
	desktopConnection.connect(this.runtimeConfiguration, listener, 10000);
```
   listener is an instance of DesktopStateListener which provides callback on status of connections to runtime.

3. Create new application when clicking on Create App:

 ```java
	Application app = new Application(options, desktopConnection, new AckListener() {
		@Override
		public void onSuccess(Ack ack) {
			Application application = (Application) ack.getSource();
			application.run();   // run the app
		}
		@Override
		public void onError(Ack ack) {
		}
	});
```
   options is an instance of ApplicationOptions, which is populated from App Create dialog.  AckListener interface provides callback for the operation.

   Once the application is created successfully, you can take actions on its window:

4.  Change opacity:

```java
	WindowOptions options = new WindowOptions();
	options.setOpacity(newOpacityValue);
	application.getWindow().updateOptions(options, null);
```

5. Change Window size

```java
	application.getWindow().resizeBy(10, 10, "top-left");
```

6. Publishes messages to a topic with InterApplicationBus

```java
	org.json.JSONObject message = createSomeJsonMessage();
	desktopConnection.getInterApplicationBus().publish("someTopic", message);
```

7. Subscribes to a topic with InterApplicationBus

```java
	desktopConnection.getInterApplicationBus().subscribe("*", "someTopic", new BusListener() {
		public void onMessageReceived(String sourceUuid, String topic, Object payload) {
			JSONObject message = (JSONObject) payload;
		}
	});
```

## Run the example of embedding HTML5 application into a Java Swing window

1. Clone this repository

2. Go to release directory and start embed.bat ( the default embedded url is https://openfin.co. Pass the url you wish to load if you want something different e.g. embed.bat https://www.mydomain.com )

3. Once the java app starts, click on "Launch OpenFin" button, which should start OpenFin Runtime and embed the OpenFin application that points to https://openfin.co (or your custom url if you specified one)

4. Click "Shutdown OpenFin" button to close HTML5 application and the Java Swing window

If there is a problem rendering the url please check your windows display settings to see ensure scaling is set to 100%.

## Source Code Review for embedded OpenFin application

Source code for the example is located in /src/main/java/com/openfin/desktop/demo/WindowEmbedDemo.java

1. create a canvas and place it where the HTML5 application should be embedded.

```java
	embedCanvas = new java.awt.Canvas();
	panel.add(embedCanvas, BorderLayout.CENTER);
```

2. listen to the canvas resize event, and resize embedded HTML5 application accordingly.

```java
	embedCanvas.addComponentListener(new ComponentAdapter() {
	    @Override
	    public void componentResized(ComponentEvent event) {
	        super.componentResized(event);
	        Dimension newSize = event.getComponent().getSize();
	        try {
	            if (startupHtml5app != null) {
	                startupHtml5app.getWindow().embedComponentSizeChange((int)newSize.getWidth(), (int)newSize.getHeight());
	            }
	        } catch (Exception e) {
	            e.printStackTrace();
	        }
	    }
	});
```

3. launch and connect to OpenFin runtime 

```java
	this.desktopConnection = new DesktopConnection(appUuid);
	DesktopStateListener listener = new DesktopStateListener() {...};
	RuntimeConfiguration configuration = new RuntimeConfiguration();
	configuration.setRuntimeVersion(desktopVersion);
	desktopConnection.connect(configuration, listener, 60);
```

4. create HTML5 application

```java
	ApplicationOptions options = new ApplicationOptions(startupUuid, startupUuid, openfin_app_url);
	WindowOptions mainWindowOptions = new WindowOptions();
	options.setMainWindowOptions(mainWindowOptions);
	DemoUtils.runApplication(options, this.desktopConnection, new AckListener() {...});
```

5. embed HTML5 application into the canvas

```java
	startupHtml5app = Application.wrap(this.startupUuid, this.desktopConnection);
	Window html5Wnd = startupHtml5app.getWindow();
	long parentHWndId = Native.getComponentID(this.embedCanvas);
	html5Wnd.embedInto(parentHWndId, this.embedCanvas.getWidth(), this.embedCanvas.getHeight(), new AckListener() {...});
```
